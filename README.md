# GPA-calculator
-- school project --
This is currently the stable version of the GPA program. Filestreaming with binary files is up and running without any bugs.
The program still needs a lot of development before having a release version.

Issue: Binary files do not work with string data type because of the variability in its size so the code has been remastered to work with char arrays and char*.

NOTE: 
  The `assign_ID()` function is still under development.
  
  Say tuned for updates. ;)
